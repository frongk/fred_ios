# SimplePreviewApp

This repository contains a minimal SwiftUI application packaged as a Swift Package.
It shows a "Hello, world!" message and can be run as a preview in Xcode.

## Building

Open the package in Xcode:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

Run the `PreviewHostApp` scheme on an iOS simulator or use the SwiftUI preview.
